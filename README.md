 #The Serendipist - Website
 
 This repo hosts my personal website, which leverages Jekyll and Netlify to serve this static website.

 I am an aspiring neuroscientist and researcher, and I am also dwelwing into data analysis. 
 Since I am not a web developer and I have minimal technical skills, I decided to invest just enough time to have a setup that is:

 - relatively cheap,
 - can be maintained fairly easily,
 - has the necessary desired features (a landing page, a blog, a portfolio and an about section), 
 - can be deployed in a short time.

 This is how I have found out about Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Netlify and Cloudflare.

 I based the process on multiple different tutorials and templates. Here are some of the most useful ones (in no particular order):
 - [Get started with Jekyll, GitHub, and Netlify](https://tseknet.com/blog/startblogging) by Dan Tsekhanskiy,
 - [Jekyll Serif Theme](https://www.zerostatic.io/theme/jekyll-serif/) by Zerostatic Themes,
 - and some (a lot of) YouTube tutorials.
